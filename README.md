# typed lambda [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/softprops/typed-lambda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/softprops/typed-lambda)

> an attempt to formalize the event types involved in [AWS lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) interfaces

Run code without thinking about servers. Write code without guessing types.

ðŸš§ The provided definitions are currently under construction ðŸš§

## ðŸ¤” why

Though there are [scattered samples of AWS Lambda events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/eventsources.html) provided by AWS exist but absent of any formal schema describing them. This repository aims to be an accurate a collection of JSON schema documents organized by lambda trigger source that describe event structural types.

So why should anyone care?

* ðŸ‘µ Human lives - Each and every AWS Lambda client binding is forced though cumbersome process of redefining these types *by hand*!
If sufficient schema's existed for AWS lambda events, this would no longer be needed as these language bindings could leverage code generation instead.

* ðŸ”§ Tooling - Tooling for lambda could more easily be synthesized with machine readable information about events

* ðŸ““ Documentation - Surprisingly what currently exists, is incomplete, and therefore only partially useful

* ðŸ‘Œ Correctness - Types can provide use to programmers even if your native programming language does not support them. Here is a [good example](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped). Types enable productivity by making it less possible to represent mispreprented data.

## ðŸ”¬ schemas

The following are provided lambda triggers ( in order for reference to AWS's documentation on [event sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invoking-lambda-function.html) ). The goal here is to define [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) docs that line up with these triggers. Contruction of an initial set of schemas is under way under the [events](events) directory of this repository. ðŸ™ˆ As schemas become formalized and tested they will be linked under the trigger sources below for reference.

## required fields

Some fields may be absent in events and some may be present with `null` values. Fields with `null` should *not* be included the json schema `required` field.

## ðŸ‘¯ get involved

This project AIMS to provide the most accurate reflection of AWS lambda types but is currently a best effort approach as no official documentation exists. If you become aware that fields are missing or incorrect. Please open a pull request containing your changes and an example payload that doesn't match the current schemas

To validate the existing schemas you will need to have `npm` installed.

Run the following

```sh
$ make test
```
