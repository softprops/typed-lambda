# typed lambda

> an attempt to formalize the event types involved in AWS lambda interfaces

## ðŸ¤” why

Though there are [scattered samples of AWS Lambda events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/eventsources.html) provided by AWS there exist to formal schema describing them. This repository is a a collection of JSON schema documents organized by lambda trigger source that describe event structural types.

So why should anyone care?

* ðŸ‘µ Human lives - Each and every AWS Lambda client binding is forced though cumbersome process of redefining these types *by hand*!
If sufficient schema's existed for AWS lambda events, this would no longer be needed as these language bindings could leverage code generation instead.

* ðŸ”§ Tooling - Tooling for lambda could more easily be synthesized with machine readable information about events

* ðŸ““ Documentation - Surprisingly what currently exists, is incomplete, and therefore only partially useful

* ðŸ‘Œ Correctness - Types can provide use to programmers even if your native programming language does not support them. Here is a [good example](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped). Types enable productivey making it less possible to represent mispreprented data.

## ðŸ‘¯ contributing

This project AIMS to provide the most accurate reflection of AWS lambda types but is currently a best effort approach as no official documentation exists. If you become aware that fields are missing or incorrect. Please open a pull request containing your changes and an example payload that doesn't match the current schemas
